# math11
Program that finds all possible combinations of the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32, and operations (+, -, \*, /) that are equal to 11. The numbers may only be used once for each calculation (4 + 4 ... = 11 is not allowed), but operations may be duplicated or left out as needed.
This assignment is written in TypeScript.

In this version the calculation rules are implemented (\* and / go before + and -).
