# math11
Write a program that finds all possible combinations of the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32, and operations (+, - *, /) that are equal to 11. The numbers may only be used once for each calculation (4 + 4 ... = 11 is not allowed), but operations may be duplicated or left out as needed.
Please use typescript for this assignment.
In this version the calculation rules are implemented ('*' and '/' go before '+' and '-').
